    <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
    <p>The roots of Mabale Growers Tea Factory can be traced back to the growing interest in tea cultivation
        in Uganda during the 20th century. The favorable climate and fertile soils of the region made it an 
        ideal location for tea farming. In the early 1990s, a group of local farmers recognized the potential
         of tea as a cash crop and began to cultivate it on a small scale. Their efforts laid the groundwork 
         for the establishment of a more organized tea production system</p>

    <h2>Establishment of the factory</h2>
    <p>In 1997, the Mabale Growers Tea Factory was officially established to process the tea leaves produced by 
        local farmers. The factory was built with the support of various stakeholders, including the Ugandan government,
         non-governmental organizations, and international development partners. The aim was to create a sustainable
          model that would empower local farmers by providing them with a reliable market for their tea.</p3>
